# YosemiteDark
A KDE Window Decoration theme that gives the appearance of a Dark-Yosemite like theme.

This was inspired by the LinuxMasterRace subreddit front page: http://reddit.com/r/linuxmasterrace

This is basically A fork of http://kde-look.org/content/show.php/Yosemite?content=168983, but this adds dark window decoration instead of the default that would appear in Mac OS X.

This is a early stage of development.
The very noticeable issues include:

    The inactive window receives a weird white border at the top.
    If a window is maximized the buttons are not centered.
  
Things that need to be changed are as follows:
  
    The edges on the top should be rounded.
    It should be borderless except for the top.
