# YosemiteDark
A KDE Window Decoration theme that gives the appearance of a Dark-Yosemite like theme.

This was inspired by the LinuxMasterRace subreddit front page: http://reddit.com/r/linuxmasterrace

This is basically A fork of http://kde-look.org/content/show.php/Yosemite?content=168983, but this adds dark window decoration instead of the default that would appear in Mac OS X.

This release marks the end of the project as I have now moved to i3, and no longer have a motive to work on the project.  The project is done with the only issue being that the edges should be rounded.  I have only the slightest idea of how to do this unfortunately.  If someone would like to complete the project, I recommend forking it with DarkYosemiteRound...

Things that need to be changed are as follows:
  
    The edges on the top should be rounded.
