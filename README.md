# YosemiteDark
A KDE Window Decoration theme that gives the appearance of a Dark-Yosemite like theme.

This was inspired by the LinuxMasterRace subreddit front page: http://reddit.com/r/linuxmasterrace

This is basically A fork of http://kde-look.org/content/show.php/Yosemite?content=168983, but this adds dark window decoration instead of the default that would appear in Mac OS X.

This is a early stage of development.

Things that need to be changed are as follows:
  
    The edges on the top should be rounded.
    It should be borderless except for the top.
    
Note:
    I corrected the weird button not centering when maximized, I also indirectly solved the inactive window having a white border by just editing the decoration file, this is not in a release yet as I am working to fix all issues and things to be changed first before a new release.  This change is available in the source code though.
